			<h2>1. First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)</h2>
			<p>In this scheduling algorithm, jobs are executed on a first come, first serve basis irrespective of burst
				time
				or priority. It is both a preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling algorithm. It is based on the First
				In
				First Out (FIFO) queue.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="ialgoright">
			<h2>2. Shortest Job First (SJF)</h2>
			<p>Also known as shortest job first (SJF), this scheduling algorithm is both a non-preemptive and preemptive
				scheduling algorithm. Process with the minimum burst time at an instance executes first. It is very
				efficient in minimizing the waiting time and is easy to implement in Batch systems. It cannot be
				implemented
				if the required CPU time is not known in advance.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="ialgoleft">
			<h2>3. Priority Scheduling</h2>
			<p>This scheduling algorithm is commonly used in batch systems and is a non-preemptive scheduling algorithm.
				In
				this each process is assigned a priority and the process with the highest priority executes first
				followed
				by the ones lower in priority. If two processes share the same priority then execution is done on a
				first
				come first served basis. Priority is decided based on memory requirements, time requirements, or any
				other
				resource requirement.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="ialgoright">
			<h2>4. Shortest Remaining Time</h2>
			<p>This scheduling algorithm is the preemptive version of the SJN algorithm. The OS allocates the
				processor to
				the job that is closest to completion. Though there is a chance of this job being preempted, if
				another job
				is ready with a shorter time to completion. It is used in batch environments where short jobs are
				given
				preference and cannot be implemented in interactive systems where required CPU time is unknown.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="ialgoleft">
			<h2>5. Round Robin (RR)</h2>
			<p>This scheduling algorithm is a preemptive process scheduling algorithm where each process is provided
				a fixed
				time to execute. This fixed time is called a quantum.It uses context switching to save states of
				preempted
				processes. Once a process is done executing for a given time period, it is preempted and another
				process
				executes for a given time period.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="ialgoright">
			<h2>6. Multiple-Level Queues Scheduling</h2>
			<p>In this scheduling algorithm multiple algorithms with common characteristics come together to form a
				group
				and then schedule jobs as a whole. Thus, it is not an independent scheduling algorithm. There are
				multiple
				queues for processes with common characteristics and each queue has its own scheduling algorithms.
				The OS
				assigns priorities to each queue.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="ialgoleft">
			<h2>7. Multilevel Feedback Queues Scheduling</h2>
			<p>This scheduling algorithm is similar to multilevel queue scheduling except that the processes here
				can change
				their queue too i.e., if a process is in queue1, then after partial execution, it can switch to
				queue2.

				There is a list of queues with different priorities and one with a higher priority queue executes
				first.
				During execution of a process with a higher priority queue comes, then the execution of the lower
				priority
				queue stops and the one with higher priority queue replaces it. There is a chance of starvation if
				the
				higher priority queue keeps coming in the ready state and the lower priority queue keeps waiting for
				its
				turn.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="ialgoright">
			<h2>8. Highest Response Ratio Next</h2>
			<p>In this scheduling algorithm, scheduling is done on the basis of response ratio. The process with the
				highest
				response ratio is scheduled next which reduces starvation in the system.
